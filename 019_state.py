# Here's a mindbender for you:

a = 10
b = 20
a = b
print(f"a is {a}")
print(f"b is {b}")

# @TASK: What does that output? And why? Take a guess, then
# run the code and see.

# Was it what you expected?
# My expectation was a=20 and b=20, because we assigned b to a, it means the value of the b assigned to the a. But the b did not change because we did not change or assign any val
# Try to puzzle it out, and then move on to
# 020_state_tables.py
